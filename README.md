# Hacking Point Minigame
## Context:
For my first project in python and to put in practice, my personal training, I decided to code a breach protocol hacking minigame. This is a little project that regroup python programming, object oriented programming and user interfaces.
## Rules:
A matrix is generated randomly and you have a random sequence to resolve. To resolve it, you need to select in order all symbols from the sequence in the matrix. The first symbol is selected on the first line. For next symbol, you need to alternate between column and line only to complete the path.

## Score:
If you resolve correctly the sequence you earn 1 score point else you lose one score point. The more points you have, more the game will be difficult.
## Saving system :
There is now a system to save your score and your win rate. Those data are encrypted to avoid cheating. When you relaunch the game, data are recovering and you can continue your last game.
## Next update:
I will add a menu to launch a game and perhaps a timer for difficult levels or for all levels.
## State:
- [X] Work in progress
- [ ] Work completed
